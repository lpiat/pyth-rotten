* depend: exempt OSX system Tcl/Tk libs from relative path rewrite

The older python.org builds that use system Tcl/Tk framework have
their _tkinter.cpython-*-darwin.so library linked against
/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.5/Tcl and
/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.5/Tk, although the
actual frameworks are located in /System/Library/Frameworks.

Therefore, we fail to recognize these libraries as system ones,
and rewrite their paths with relative ones. The resulting program
fails to run due to missing libraries (as we do not bundle them).

To fix the issue, these two libraries need to be explicitly
exempted from the path overwrite.
